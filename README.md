# Noon Internship Portfolio (React)

One repo contains 6 mini-projects as routes.
Built to showcase practical React skills fast.

## Projects
- Catalog: search, filters, sorting, pagination, route params
- Cart + Checkout: localStorage, coupon logic, validation
- Admin Dashboard: table, filters, charts (recharts)
- Auth: login/register, protected routes, token mock
- API Products: fetch + retry + favorites
- UI Clone: responsive layout + mini slider

## Run
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Split into 6 repos later
Copy one folder from `src/projects/<name>` into a fresh Vite React project and wire routes as needed.
